# Accessible Portfolio

 ARIA roles 
 
 ARIA is a set of attributes you can add to HTML elements that define ways to make web content and applications accessible to users with disabilities who use assistive technologies (AT).
 
 Let's re-do the Portfolio we made earlier and add aria- roles to different sections to make it more accessible.
 Following table contains role's name along with the tag there are supposed to be bind with.
 
`role        tag`

`img        img`

`heading        h1`

`list        ul`

`listitem        li`

`navigation        nav`

Bind all the tag with correct aria role and render them in the DOM.
